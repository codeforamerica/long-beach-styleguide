<h1>Web / Digital First -> Print Second</h1>
<ul>Why housing information on PDFs in websites is not ideal
<li>Pdfs are not search friendly</li>
<li>Pdfs can't translate via google translate</li>
<li>Pdfs are not screenreader friendly</li>
<li>Confusing wayfinding to have content split between web pages and pdfs </li>
<li>Web is easier to update as information changes</li>
<li>Web materials can be accessed anywhere at anytime, while for print you have to be in a specific place physically to access the materials. </li>
</ul>
